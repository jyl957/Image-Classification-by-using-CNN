# Image-Classification-by-using-CNN
Project Name：Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

Project Description：Convolutional neural network(CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm which can extract the features of images by using image convolution and be able to differentiate one image from the other. In this project, Matlab was used to recognize and classify the images of five different goods.

Project Responsibility：The image dataset of five goods was created to train and validate the CNN. Multilayer neural network was created to assign weights and biases to various objects in the image. After some epochs, five images not in the dataset were categorized using trained network.
